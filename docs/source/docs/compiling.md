 - tagline: Using Fable as part of your node applications

# Compiling to JavaScript


You can install the `fable-compiler` package from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fable-compiler)
either locally or globally. Here we'll assume it's been installed globally so the `fable`
command is available from any directory.

The simplest way to compile a F# project (`.fsproj`) or script (`.fsx`) is
to pass its path as an argument to `fable`:

```shell
npm install -g fable-compiler

fable path/to/your/project.fsproj
```

> Note: If you're having problems to compile a project, make sure
you are using the latest version of the compiler. If you installed it globally,
you can update it with `npm install -g fable-compiler`. You can see the version
installed with `fable --help` and the latest version available in npm with `npm info fable-compiler version`.

> If you have problems on Windows [see this](https://github.com/fable-compiler/Fable#requirements).

## CLI options

Besides the default argument (`--projFile`), the following options are available:

Option                  | Short     | Description
------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------
`--outDir`              | `-o`      | Where to put compiled JS files. Defaults to project directory.
`--module`              | `-m`      | Specify module code generation: `commonjs` (default), `amd`, `umd` or `es2015`.
`--sourceMaps`          | `-s`      | Generate source maps: `false` (default), `true` or `inline`.
`--watch`               | `-w`      | Recompile project much faster on file modifications.
`--ecma`                |           | Specify ECMAScript target version: `es5` (default) or `es2015`.
`--symbols`             |           | F# symbols for conditional compilation, like `DEBUG`.
`--plugins`             |           | Paths to Fable plugins.
`--babelPlugins`        |           | Additional Babel plugins (without `babel-plugin-` prefix). Must be installed in the current directory.
`--loose`               |           | Enable “loose” transformations for babel-preset-es2015 plugins (true by default).
`--babelrc`             |           | Use a `.babelrc` file for Babel configuration (invalidates other Babel related options).
`--refs`                |           | Specify dll or project references in `Reference=js/import/path` format (see below).
`--msbuild`             |           | Pass MSBuild arguments like `Configuration=Release`.
`--clamp`               |           | Compile unsigned byte arrays as Uint8ClampedArray.
`--copyExt`             |           | Copy external files into `fable_external` folder (true by default).
`--coreLib`             |           | In some cases, you may need to pass a different route to the core library, like `--coreLib fable-core/es2015`.
`--verbose`             |           | Print more information about the compilation process.
`--target`              | `-t`      | Use options from a specific target in `fableconfig.json`.
`--debug`               | `-d`      | Shortcut for `--target debug`.
`--production`          | `-p`      | Shortcut for `--target production`.
`--declaration`         |           | [Experimental] Generates corresponding ‘.d.ts’ file.
`--extra`               |           | Custom options for plugins in `Key=Value` format.
`--help`                | `-h`      | Display usage guide.

> Besides `projFile`, all paths (`outDir`, `plugins`...) will be considered relative to
the project file directory if they're not absolute, but see `fableconfig.json` below.

## Project references

You can use `--refs` argument to link referenced dll or projects with the JS import path that must be used,
using the following format: `[Reference name without extension]=[JS import path]`.

### Example: project reference

```shell
fable src/lib/MyLib.fsproj --outDir out/lib
fable src/main/MyProject.fsproj --refs MyLib=../lib
```

### Example: dll refence

We assume we have an npm package with the following structure:

```text
my-lib/
    js/MyLib.js
    bin/MyLib.dll
```

If we are referencing `node_modules/bin/MyLib.dll` in our project,
we can tell Fable to replace the refence with the JS code using the
argument below (note if we are using node or a bundler like Webpack
we can omit `./node_modules/` in the JS import path).

```shell
fable src/main/MyProject.fsproj --refs MyLib=my-lib/js
```

> See [fable-helpers-sample](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fable-helpers-sample) to know how to publish a Fable package.

TODO: Explain how to use the JsReference attribute

## fableconfig.json

Rather than passing all the options to the CLI, it may be more convenient to put them
in JSON format in a file named `fableconfig.json` and let the compiler read them for you.
You can combine options from the CLI and `fableconfig.json`, when this happens the former will have preference.

To use `fableconfig.json` just pass the directory where the JSON file resides to Fable.
If you omit the path, the compiler will assume it's in the current directory.

```shell
fable my/path/
```

> Note that in this case, all path configurations (`projFile`, `outDir`, `plugins`...) will be
relative to the directory where `fableconfig.json` resides.

Project references can be passed using a plain object:

```shell
{
  "refs": {
    "MyLib": "../lib",
    "MyNs.AnotherProject": "../another"
  }
}
```

There are some options exclusive to `fableconfig.json`.

* **scripts**: Commands that should be executed during specific phases of compilation.
  Currently `prebuild`, `postbuild` and `postbuild-once` are accepted. For example, if you want
  to run tests defined in the npm `package.json` file after the build you can write.

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "postbuild": "npm run test"
    }
}
```

> `postbuild` will also run for every compilation in watch mode. If you only want
to run the script after the first full compilation, use `postbuild-once`.

> The scripts will run as if you typed the command on a terminal window from
the directory where `fableconfig.json` is. Fable scripts are not as powerful
as npm scripts in `package.json`: if you want to run a binary from a local
npm package you must specify the full path (e.g. use `node node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack`
instead of just `webpack`). But you can always call an npm script from `fableconfig.json`
as in the sample above.

* **targets**: You can group different options in targets. If you don't want,
  say, source maps when deploying for production, you can use a config file as
  seen below. When a target is specified, the options in the target will
  override the default ones. Activate the target by passing it to the CLI:
  `fable --target production`.


```json
{
    "sourceMaps": true,
    "targets": {
        "production": {
            "sourceMaps": false
        }
    }
}
```

When using a node `package.json` file, it's also possible to specify the minimum
version of Fable required to compile the project.

```json
{
    "engines": {
        "fable": "0.1.3"
    }
}
```


## fable-core

[Fable's core library](https://github.com/fable-compiler/Fable/blob/master/import/core/fable-core.js) must be included in the project.
When targeting node or using a module bundler you only need to add the dependency:

```shell
npm install --save fable-core
```

If targeting the browser and using AMD instead, you can load Fable's core lib with
[require.js](http://requirejs.org) as follows:

```html
<script src="node_modules/requirejs/require.js"></script>
<script>
requirejs.config({
    // Set the baseUrl to the path of the compiled JS code
    baseUrl: 'out',
    paths: {
        // Explicit path to core lib (relative to baseUrl, omit .js)
        'fable-core': '../node_modules/fable-core/fable-core.min'
    }
});
// Load the entry file of the app (use array, omit .js)
requirejs(["app"]);
</script>
```


## Polyfill

When not using `--ecma es2015` or `--module es2015` (see below), after going through Babel pipeline
the code won't include any syntax foreign to ES5. However several ES2015 classes (like `Symbol`)
are used so it's advisable to include a polyfill like [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js)
to make sure the code works fine in any browser.

You can include the polyfill in a `script` tag in your HTML file before loading
the generated JS code like:

```html
<script src="node_modules/core-js/client/core.min.js"></script>
```

Or you can import it directly in your F# code if you're using a bundler like
Webpack or Browserify right before the entry point of your app.

```fsharp
open Fable.Core

JsInterop.importAll "core-js"
```

> The polyfill is not necessary when targeting node 4.4 or above.

> Babel includes [its own polyfill](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/)
with a lazy-sequence generator, but this is not needed as one is already included
in [fable-core.ts](https://github.com/fable-compiler/Fable/blob/master/src/fable/Fable.Core/npm/fable-core.ts).


## Modules

The compiler will keep the file structure of the F# project, wrapping each file in a [ES2015 module](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#modules).

According to the `--module` argument (see above), these modules can be transformed again by Babel to
[umd](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) (the default), [amd](http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html), [commonjs](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html), or not at all.

In the browser, when not using a bundler like Webpack or Browserify, you'll need a module loader like [require.js](http://requirejs.org) to start up the app.

When a F# file makes a reference to another, the compiler will create an [import statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/import)
in the generated Javascript code. You can also generate imports by using the [Import attribute](interacting.html).

As JS must import external modules with an alias, there's no risk of namespace
collision so, for convenience, the compiler will use the minimum route to access
external objects. Meaning that if you have a F# file with one root module:

```fsharp
module MyNs1.MyNs2.MyModule

let myProperty = "Hello"
```

To access `myProperty` the generated code will import the file with an alias, say `$import0`,
and directly access the property from it: `$import0.myProperty`. The route has been eluded
as it's not necessary to prevent name conflicts. In the same way, if you have a file
with two modules:

```fsharp
namespace MyNs1.MyNs2

module MyModule1 =
    let myProperty = "Hello"

module MyModule2 =
    let myProperty = "Bye"
```

This time the compiler will omit the namespace but keep the F# module names,
as they're necessary to prevent name conflicts in the same file:

```js
$import0.MyModule1.myProperty !== $import0.MyModule2.myProperty
```

> Note: When referencing a module or type from another file, Fable will automatically create
the imports for the specific members you need. This allows [tree shaking](http://www.2ality.com/2015/12/webpack-tree-shaking.html)
but it also means using a `#load` directive in a script file just for the side effects
(for example, to run some code on the other file) won't work. Functions on the other
file must be called explicitly.


## Debugging

You can debug the generated JS code normally. Also, if you pass the `sourceMaps`
option to the compiler, it'll be possible to debug the F# code (with some limitations).
This is automatic for browser apps. For node, you'll need a tool like [node-inspector](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector)
or a capable IDE. In the case of Visual Studio Code, you can find instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging)
(see Node Debugging > JavaScript Source Maps).


## Testing

You can use any JS testing library to write tests for your project, but to make it
easier to share code across platforms, a plugin is available to make
[NUnit](http://www.nunit.org) tests compatible with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org).
Check [the tutorial](http://fable-compiler.github.io/samples/nunit/index.html) for more info.

## Samples

There are several samples available in the [repository](https://github.com/fable-compiler/Fable/blob/master/samples) and you can also download them from [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/alfonsogarciacaro/fable/artifacts/samples.zip).
Every sample includes a `fableconfig.json` file so they can be compiled just by running
the `fable` command in the sample directory (or from a different directory by passing the route).
Just be sure to install the npm dependencies the first time.

```shell
npm install
fable
```

> Note: `fableconfig.json` in most of the samples runs `npm install` before compilation
so usually this step is automatic.


Now it's your turn to build a great app with Fable and show it to the world!
